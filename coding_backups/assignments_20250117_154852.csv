My current job is office work. Most of it is unnecessary paperwork that helps people log how to charge other people money. Often I wait at my computer for tasks and have little to do. Not all jobs are like this.,Unassigned
I think it can depend but for a majority of people your job is just a financial necessity and not terribly fulfilling,Unassigned
All the friends I got from my job are mean,Unassigned
Because a job can be rewarding in other ways if we enjoy our work. It is subjective.,Unassigned
To me that's what a job is. It's not meant to be fun or life-fulfilling.,Unassigned
